## 5. Payment terms

### 5.1 Payment

Subscription holders agree to pay the monthly, annual, or course fee specified when you purchase a Subscription.

Any agreement you have with your payment provider will govern your use of your specified payment method. You agree that we may accumulate charges incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each billing cycle. Your failure to terminate and/or continued use of your Subscription reaffirms that we are authorized to charge you for that Subscription. We may submit those charges for payment and you will be responsible for such charges. This does not waive our right to seek payment directly from you.

### 5.2 Billing Authorization

You may be asked to provide a credit, charge or debit card number from a card issuer that we accept in order to activate your Subscription – your authorizations in this Section also apply to our payment processor and any other company who acts as a billing agent for us.
